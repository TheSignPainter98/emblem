# `.def`

This directive defines a directive function...
<!-- TODO: finish this -->

- Defines a new directive
- Mention no preceding ‘.’
- Mention how the arguments are handled and expansion using exclamation marks to widen the scope
	- (This method now works as it ought to with successive `!` symbols causing _skips_ not absolute scope ignores
	- This ought to link to the `.get-var` doc

# `.h1`, `.h2`, `.h3`, `.h4`, `.h5`, `.h6`

These directives create level 1--6 headers respectively, that is, markers to delimit the sections of a document to the reader.
These headers be numbered and will appear in the table of contents.
To create a header which does _not_ appear in the =toc,= the starred variants may be used, that is `.h1*` in place of `.h1` etc.

The header directives take a single argument, the text of the header.

Given the frequency with which headers appear in documents, syntactic sugar is available---any line which starts with between one and six hashes and some space will have the remainder of the line taken as a header, just as in markdown.
Hence the line `.h3: some text` is the same as `### some text`.
Similarly, `.h3*: some other text` is the same as `###* some other text`.

## Example -- Document structure

Sections can be used to break different parts of a document (or in this case presentation script) into smaller marked areas for consumption by an intended audience.

```emblem
# Introduction
Hello and welcome to our presentation on the dangers of garden gnomes.
# Why Garden Gnomes are Dangerous
You might not know this but garden gnomes are dangerous.
## What a Garden Gnome can do
You never know what a gnome will do when your back is turned.
## What Have Garden Gnomes Been Observed Doing?
Nobody has been able to record any suspicious activity in relation to garden gnomes, but that's exactly what they'd want.
# Conclusion
Watch your back out there, kiddos.
```

## Example -- Document sections (exhaustive document)

The following is an exhaustive list of available headers and their related syntactic sugars.

```emblem
.h1: This is the largest header
.h2: This is a sub-header
.h3: This is a sub-sub-header
.h4: This header is even deeper
.h5: This is an extremely deep header
.h6: This header is so deep its utility is questionable but here it is

# This is the largest header
## This is a sub-header
### This is a sub-sub-header
#### This header is even deeper
##### This is an extremely deep header
###### This header is so deep its utility is questionable but here it is

.h1*: This appears the same as `.h1` but is un-numbered and absent from the TOC
.h2*: Same as the above but smaller
.h3*: Same as the above but smaller
.h4*: Same as the above but smaller
.h5*: Same as the above but smaller
.h6*: Same as the above but smaller

#* This appears the same as `.h1` but is un-numbered and absent from the TOC
##* Same as the above but smaller
###* Same as the above but smaller
####* Same as the above but smaller
#####* Same as the above but smaller
######* Same as the above but smaller

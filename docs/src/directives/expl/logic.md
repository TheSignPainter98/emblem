# Logic

To augment the capabilities of the [flow control directives][flow-directives], it is possible to construct logical conditions from other statements.

In particular, directives are provided to:

- [Compute equality][equality]
- [Compute inequality][inequalities]
- [Handle boolean values][boolean]

These are discussed in this section.

[flow-directives]: ./flow-control.md
[equality]: ../equality.md
[inequalities]: ../inequalities.md
[boolean]: ./boolean.md

# Logging

Some directives can be used to report the state of the document, either for general information ([`.echo`][echo]), for warning the user about a possibly problematic state ([`.warn`][warn]) or for halting execution at a catastrophic failure ([`.error`][error]).

[warn]: ../warn.md
[echo]: ../echo.md
[error]: ../error.md

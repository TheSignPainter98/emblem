# Arithmetic

Directives are provided to handle numbers.
They do what one might expect, they take numbers, operate upon them and output a number.
This section details these directives.

When parsing numbers, it is important to note some things.
In particular, numbers:

- are in base-10
- cannot contain spaces
- can be negative
- can contain fractional parts (after the radical point)
- can be \\( \pm \infty \\)
- can be NaN (not-a-number)

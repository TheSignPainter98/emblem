# Flow control

Some directives can be used to manipulate the contents of the document in response to some conditions.
Indeed, this subset of available directives are designed to act as a small Turing-complete programming language.

Over the following sections, we will explore directives for:

- Branching
	[`.case`][case]
	[`.if`][if]
	[`.ifelse`][ifelse]
- Looping
	[`.foreach`][foreach]
- Handling directives
	[`.call`][call]
	[`.def`][def]
	[`.exists`][exists]
	[`.undef`][undef]
- Handling variables
	[`.defined`][defined]
	[`.get-var`][get-var]
	[`.set-var`][set-var]

[call]: ../call.md
[case]: ../case.md
[def]: ../def.md
[defined]: ../defined.md
[exists]: ../exists.md
[foreach]: ../foreach.md
[get-var]: ../get-var.md
[if]: ../if.md
[ifelse]: ../ifelse.md
[set-var]: ../set-var.md
[undef]: ../undef.md
[while]: ../while.md

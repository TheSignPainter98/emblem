# References

Any respectable document needs a way of referring to content both within and without, the former being used to soundly structure the arguments of a document, and the latter to invoke facts presented elsewhere.

In Emblem, these two modes of reference are handled by two systems:

- The [anchor-and-reference][anchor-and-ref] system for internal links and
- The [bibliography-and-citation][bib-and-cite] system for external links.

The concepts presented in this section will likely be familiar to LaTeX users as much inspiration has been taken from the `\label`, `\ref`, `\bibliography` and `\cite` commands therein.

[anchor-and-ref]: ../anchor-and-ref.md
[bib-and-cite]: ../bib-and-cite.md

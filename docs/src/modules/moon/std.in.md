# `std.in/`

This module collection provides the machinery for defining and implementing the core set of input drivers.

Its most important file is [`std.in.drivers`](../../generated/ext/lib/std/in/drivers.moon.md), which contains the code to handle parsing inputs and which defines some useful classes for input drivers.
All other modules in this module collection are implementations of input drivers which are always available when running Emblem.

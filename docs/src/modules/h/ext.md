# `ext/`

This directory contains the code which manages and interacts with extension space.
It allows the execution of arbitrary Lua code as the program executes and is the module primarily responsible for Emblemâ€™s extensibility.

In the [source code][repo-url], the [standard extension library][std-lib-doc] is defined in the `lib/` directory beneath this one.
